# Linked List

Date: 11/03/2022

Application Vesrsion: 0.1.0

Python Verstion: 3.9.5

Overview:

This application creates a linked list, which is a list of nodes, each node has a value and a pointer to the next node if exists. The benefit of this over ordinary list is the freedom in creation location inside the memory.

This linked list has three methods:

 - `insert`: to add a node to the head of the linked list. The time complexity of it is O(1)

 - `append`: to add a node to the end of the linked list. The time complexity of it is O(n)

 - `includes`: to search for a node's value in the linked list. The time complexity of it is O(n)

 This application has been created as a solution to the code challenge 5. You can test the file by running (pytest), I recommend you install (poetry) package before that.
