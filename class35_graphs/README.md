## Overview:

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

- `Vertex` - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- `Edge` - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- `Neighbor` - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- `Degree` - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

This application contains the following inside HashTable calss:

- `add_node` -  Add a node to the graph
- `add_edge` -  Add an edge between two vertices the graph
- `get_nodes` -  Get all nodes from the graph
- `get_neighbors` -  Get all neighbors of a node
- `size` -  Get the size of the graph
- `breadth_first` -  Get the breadth first traversal of the graph
