## Overview:

This is an aplication to create and manipullate trees. You can use this application for binary trees and for k-ary-trees.

### `Binarytree`: A class to traverse any binary tree. It has the following methods:

- `pre_order`, `pre_order_recursive`: A method to traverse the tree elements in post-order. O(n)
- `in_order`, `in_order_recursive`: A method to traverse the tree elements in in-order. O(n)
- `post_order`, `post_order_recursive`: A method to traverse the tree elements in in-order. O(n)

### `BinarySearchtree`: A class to manipulate the binary tree. it has the following methods:

- `insert`: A method to insert a node to the tree. O(n)
_ `find`: A method to find a node in the tree. O(n)
